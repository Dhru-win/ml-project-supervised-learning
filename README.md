# machine_learning_project-supervised-learning


### Project Description:

The data set for this project is the "Diabetes" dataset from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases 
The project will involve the following tasks:

-	Exploratory data analysis and pre-processing: We will import and clean the data sets, analyze and visualize the relationships between the different variables, handle missing values and outliers, and perform feature engineering as needed.

-	Supervised learning: We will use the Diabetes dataset to build a machine learning model that can predict whether a patient has diabetes or not, using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy

### Project Outcomes

 - to use supervised learning techniques to build a machine learning model that can predict whether a patient has diabetes or not, based on certain diagnostic measurements.
 - processes
 * exploratory data analysis
 * preprocessing and feature engineering
 * trained two machine learning model and compare their accuracy. 


 ### results 

  - Decision tree yelded 72% accuracy whereas Random forest yelded 74% accuracy
  - Evenwith high accuracy random forest modal overfits so we will go with the decision tree instead (for now)

  ### future goals 

-will do more advanced feature engeneering and data transformation of features and make some tweaks in the modal to imporove accuracy of both models
