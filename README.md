# Supervised Machine learning project 

## Goal:

To predict whether or not a patent has or is at risk of diabetes by using a machine learning model.

### Project Description:

The data set for this project is the "Diabetes" dataset from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases 
The project will involve the following tasks:

### Project Outcomes

 To use supervised learning techniques to build a machine learning model that can predict whether a patient has diabetes or not, based on certain diagnostic measurements.
 
 ### processes


1. Exploratory data analysis

2. pre-processing

3. build two machine learning models

4. Test models and compare their accuracy

 ### Results 

  #### Decision Tree 

  **Accuracy Score = 72 %**

  **Precision accuracy = 57%**
  **Recall accuracy = 58%**

  #### Random forest 

  **Accuracy Score**

  **Precision Accuracy = 71%**
  **Recall Accuracy = 43%**
